The data in this directory are from Phad et al. 2022. Clonal structure, stability and dynamics of 
human memory B cells and circulating plasmablasts.  
https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-022-01230-1.pdf.

Read data were downloaded from:
https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/experiments/E-MTAB-11697
https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/experiments/E-MTAB-11174
and processed using CellRanger 6.1.

Two datasets were not found in the above data and obtained separately from Ganesh Phad:
D1_Nov2018_PB/s71a_VDJ
D1_Nov2018_PB/s71b_VDJ

All the data are contained in files all_contig_annotations.json.lz4.

All files were preprocessed with the enclone program shrink_json to remove annotations and
thereby reduce file size.

The file phad.meta may be used to run these data through enclone.  Use the BUILT_IN option
to recover the annotations there were removed.

Example:

enclone PRE=enclone-data/big_inputs/version15/phad META=phad.meta BUILT_IN NOPRINT SUMMARY

where the path after PRE= should be the complete path to this directory.
